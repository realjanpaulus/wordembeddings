0,negative,Eric C. Gosh,We have several units from Pyle The PA works great with the wireless mic Everything else is erratic and inconsistent even with their other PA systems I have reached out to Pyle several times they have asked me to register the product on the site which I did however I was never sent a confirmation so it seems I can not get warranty support Going on the site you can find that I registered the devices multiple time and still nothing They have stopped responding to emails I am going to try to call them one more time tomorrow and if I can not get this resolved I am going to return this purchase and sell the other we purchased previously Its a great value if you are just using the wireless mic but everything else is a miss,True,0.0,03.01.2018,139
2,neutral,John A. Theotonio,Took two of these to get one that worked First one started smoking the instant I plugged in the AC power Amazon was great on replacing it within days New one seems to be working Only time will tell I know Amazon calls these products Amazon Basics and they sure do seem to be very basic but functional I did have an issue with one flash drive when I plugged it into this hub I kept getting a message that the drive was not compatible with the current operating system windows and I need to reformat Caused me worrybut I made sure that nothing was on the flash drive needed and I did the reformat Works,True,0.0,15.01.2018,116
3,negative,CP,The switch worked for the first few months then I just watched TV and not the DVD connected to port so I do not know when it actually stopped working Now after a couple years having the switch installed it will not hold the signal from the DVD on port With the DVD playing and the cable box off it keeps switching between DVD a good signal and cable no signal I would have tried connecting a V power supply to the supplied DC input port but I do not have the necessary coaxial plug,False,0.0,17.07.2018,95

9,neutral,Kiyo M.,I use this mainly for outdoor when playing basketball with friends The hour battery life is misleading I fully charge it every time and I get the low battery warning after hours I also have the Sony XB which has a better battery life and better for casual listening but these are better if you want to really blast your music and have bass I really hate bluetooth speakers that has to announce to the whole world Power on Just turn on and off without annoyances like that the Sony XB does not do that but this does Also these are kind of heavy to carry If you want portability this is not it The carry case is more like a glove cover where its not really that secure I do like that there is a pocket on the top where I can store my mp playersmartphone in there At first I did not realize there was a slit opening on the back of the casing so I was removing the speaker from the case every time to charge but you do not have to do that There is also a small opening to access the buttons on the casing too Pros More for outdoor usebass more powerful than the Sony XB Cons hour battery life is misleading I get only hours of continuous use playing it loud before it gives me low battery warning Cloth case cover is not that secure not that well designed seems more like an afterthought Pretty heavy and large I hate speakers that has to announce loudly Power On just turn on without any annoyances like that If you want large booming bass for outdoor use this is a better choice than the Sony XB However the trade off is weaker battery life heavy to carry around and not for low volume casual listening,False,0.0,18.05.2018,310

18,neutral,Matt Crouse,First I consider myself very tech savvy and have a pretty good understanding what is possible with this type of technology Second I am fairly disappointed in the Arlo Security System Despite the overwhelming number of positive reviews I do not think this product deserves the fan support it has acquired I am trying to use this product to record my elderly dog using our deck stairs He has had falls in the past and we want to be altered every time he uses the stairs so we can watch him and come to his rescue if he has troubles For this use case I was attracted to the Arlo system because it was Battery Powered had motion detection night vision days of free recording and had push notifications Unfortunately all but the night vision and day recording live up to the hype Pros Wireless range is impressive Magnet mounting system is both cool and practical Weather resistant Video is clear and crisp Night vision is impressive given the devices size Phone app Cons Motion detection is unreliable and seems to only work if a significant portion of the screen is in motion aka not suitible for covering a large area like a front lawn but good for a specific location like JUST the front door Battery life is questionable only used for hours and the battery is already at no Zones If This Then That functionality is false advertising as far as I am concerned as its limited to IF camera A detection motion the do you want it to record or not can not even have IF camera A detects motion tell all cameras to record I question the weather resistance and notice that many people buy the silicone covers I have timed the motion delay from seconds to seconds No desktop app to receive desktop notifications What the devices is good for It is good for a no hassle video security solution for monitoring a specific space that does not get much activity would not use for a baby cam for an example If you want to monitor a door or a specific small room I think it would work well What the device is bad for Monitoring any large space Motion detection seems only sensitive to large objects making large movements hence if you are recording a large space all the moving actors will be too small to trigger recording,True,0.0,21.05.2018,404

148,positive,Big Kev,Right out of the box this AVR Rocks I have been a ONKYO Fan for a long time For one reason they have always for whatever reason underrated the true Wattage Power of their transformers Like Overclocking in the computer world their Receivers usually hit higher than advertised One thing that really impresses me about this rig is that whatever you plug in with HDMI has intelligent design For example I watch our Cable TV I go over and turn on the BluRay player and insert a Disc as the door closes this unit automatically senses the disc loading up and switches to that mode The sound so like ONKYO is superior to anything in its price range and probably anything for hundreds of dollars more I love loud music Led Zeppelin Pink Floyd etc So when I put on a vinyl Record or CD and crank it up I can go to the hilt rattle windows before any sense of distortion is heard In fact I have not been able to detect any distortion at all and I have turned this almost all the way up There may be some at volume but if you have it that loud things may break in your home from the crisp pounding Bass Speaking of which I am a recording musician so many stereos emulate Bass and other frequencies that really sound flat or not quite real this unit produces musical instruments like they were meant to be heard especially from vinyl which in my opinion is still far superior in total realism and clarity The one thing I can say that seems strange to me is that the sound drops off to a indiscernible level at the volume setting of You would think it would do so much closer to Zero I really do not know what the top setting is I have not been able to go louder than at that level the windows in my house are rattling Does it go to Maybe I must add that I have not utilized the systems self adjusting speaker balancing software I do not think this is relevant in my environment as I have only main spoeakers so its set up in Stereo Mode This may have something to do with it do not know Our Home Theatre is downstairs where I have an older ONKYO AVR in a Setting at that does operate differently with speakers Theatre Stereo Anyway I highly recommend this AVR You can spend a lot more A good friend of mine has a K Plus DENON AVR and when he haerd this he simply said man did I get ripped your ONKYO kicks my DENONs butt,True,0.0,08.01.2018,449

150,neutral,KP,I would have given it star because it sounded so good I bought this for the training room at my company so that we did not have to do your traditional wall mount speakers with wires going all over the place It was a great buy and well worth it I will give you all the rating Sound Quality The quality of sound was great The roar and tetra bass excellent You can hear the all the Hz from the whole spectrum playing It gave enough mid bass to even rumble the table and stand The highs was clear and crisp I played all sorts of music through it I even included some training materials where a person spoke through the training This is a must have for those wanting to use this in a training class or a trainer who travels to train this would be a good item to take with them to assist with the noise Connectivity For I would have expected more Sure there is a lot of ways you can connect play your music even bluetooth When I paired my phone to it and streamed music it was spotty The I LTE on my phone and when the sound came out of my phone speakers they were good but it seem like either my phones bluetooth is not good or something is getting in the way of the the transmission I deemed its not my phone because i use bluetooth in my car and stream and there is no connection issues The other thing is you must disconnect your device before connect to the speaker Paying dollars and you can not connect devices simultaneously is not a good feature Cost For you get great sound but connectivity really lacked and slacked There are many other competitors who have better connectivity I would recommend Creative be more intuitive on the connectivity of this device Especially if they are asking consumers to fork up bucks for a bluetooth speaker Overall what made it only star instead of was the connectivity and the price you pay If this unit was around it would be worth while But being at you would expect more from the connectivity standpoint,False,0.0,14.02.2018,369

716,negative,Guy Dagar,I bought this about months ago for my Mac Pro and it worked well until recently when it began doing the same thing another reviewer reported when my Mac goes to sleep it disconnects all drives connected to it And it seems to go off and on numerous times during the night while sleeping I wake up to as many as six notifications for each that drives were improperly disconnected This is very disappointing as those drives are used for backup and some contain operating systems Typically this messes up the drives directory and then it needs to be repaired via DiskWarrior and I have to spend a fair amount of time checking that the backups were completed successfully I can not recommend this Sonnet product although I have generally been satisfied with many of their other products over the years I would return it if I could and I would even now buy the pro version if I thought it would not have the same problem,True,2.0,25.03.2018,167

739,negative,Scott A,I tried making this set my primary several different times over the past year I ended up throwing it in the garbage The finishes and build quality are fantastic but the design are usage are simply terrible The keyboard design leaves no space between the three sections probably to try to save space so its incredibly easy to accidentally hit the wrong keys when doing simple touch typing The undersized backspace being placed next to the fullsized insert key was the biggest frustration When I was not accidentally hitting wrong keys it would miss my keystrokes on a fairly regular basis exacerbated by the really soft action The connection between the keyboard and USB dongle just did not seem to be that solid The bundled mouse was equally beautiful and comfortable but just plain heavy One of the cool design features with it though is that you can actually still use it with just one battery I tried this to see if it would help make the bulky mouse more comfortable but it only made it unbalanced and awkward to use for smaller movements The BIGGEST problem I had with the set was this Every time the computer is woken from sleep restarted or turned on you have to plug in the USB dongle You literally have to pull it out and plug it back in just to get the mouse and keyboard to recognize they are connected to something You guys I have used dozens of wireless accessories over the years and have literally NEVER had to do this Ever All said the whole experience was a complete disappointment especially hardware made by the biggest name in PCs,True,3.0,16.01.2018,279

770,neutral,Jeff,Allow me to start this review by saying I own two Apple Thunderbolt Displays at home so I am a bit spoiled However as Apple no longer makes displays and I have heard people say that Dell displays have the same picture quality as Apples I decided to give it a try when my old display died at work First of all I realized going into this that I would not be getting any Thunderbolt or Ethernet ports on this display While that is certainly a bummer I do not really use either at work so it was not a big deal for me I would never settle for this at home I also realized Id have to set the brightness contrast etc using buttons on the display itself instead of in the software but I have done that before so that is a minor annoyance at worst What really surprised me was that Id need to use two computer ports to hook it up one for the video and one for the USB I guess that is what you get when you buy a nonApple display but its still annoying to have to waste a USB port on that What I find even more odd though is the selection of cables that came with the display VGAtoVGA HDMItoHDMI USBAtoUSB B I had to look this one up I have never seen a USB B port before I am a bit surprised that it came with a VGA cable since I thought that went out years ago I would much rather it have come with a Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable as is I had to purchase that separately since neither of the video cables that came with it would actually work with my MBP that is somewhat minor though What I find particularly interesting is the ostensible anachronism of pairing a current video cable HDMI with an outdated data cable USBA Personally my computer has three USBA ports and no USBC so this actually better for me But if I had a more modern computer Id be seriously annoyed by what seems a surprising oversight Now let us get to the display on its own merits There are two significant problems first the placement of the USB ports The two USB ports are on the back of the display they are not in a tremendously odd place but they are a bit difficult to access The two USB ports however are on the side of the displaynot the side of the back but actually on the side And as if that were not odd enough when the display is rotated into portrait mode they are on the top Who designed this Who actually sat there and said You know what let us make a display that when in portrait mode has every one of its USB ports on top that is a great place for them On the subject of portrait mode I would also point out that my displayand I have no idea if this is normal for the model or if its just mineis perhaps off of vertical Its not horrible but it is noticeable and it makes everything on the screen just slightly diagonal In short its a halfway decent display probably exactly what I should expect in this price range But it also has a lot of minor problems that I would think very easy to overcome if someone actually sat down and thought about it,False,0.0,26.06.2018,581

869,negative,Rhamnetin,I really wonder how anyone can say anything positive about this headphone I can not even give this headphone a rating anymore It gets star because it is only good for one thing guitar solos On complex tracks it loses coherence and sounds become meshed together As far as its technical abilities go it has excellent detail retrieval poor bass extension and one of the worst treble responses I have ever encountered both with awful peaks and dips to create an altogether unnatural colored and fatiguing presentation It has a little midbass boost to trick people into thinking its bass performance is not poor but like most dynamic headphones it is incapable of delivering subbass Completely rolled in the lower frequencies though the mid bass quality is not at all bad The mids consist of Audio Technicas signature nasally vocals a signature for this lineup at least not their M lineup for both male and female vocals This is the best case scenario worst case is shouty vocals The mids have a more forward presentation especially string instruments All it can do fairly well here are acoustic guitarslutes namely solos Its terrible for classical as all sounds get bunched together since this headphone has abysmal instrument separation and imaging and no this is not a problem with all closed back headphones my ZMF Blackwood has no issues here or anywhere Upper mids are fatiguing many female vocalists are shouty and robotic The treble is the worst I have ever heard Both piercing and recessed at the same time with the utmost noticeable ringing at around KHz Its like the sound effect that plays in video games when someone hits you with a flashbang grenade a ringing sound This is a known characteristic of this headphone It ruins the entire sound spectrum though is not always present since not all music reaches the KHz range But below this the treble is still unnatural uneven fatiguing yet recessed Cymbals sound incredibly fake sibilance is noticeable Physically this headphone is inferior to various sub headphones from companies like Beyerdynamic and even Sennheiser No detachable cable cheap light plastic construction stupid D wing design that makes no sense and puts all weight on your ears its a light headphone though so it is not uncomfortable The only thing nice about it is the wooden cups they have a nice finish that is the only good thing about this headphone do not blame my equipment I have tested it with a Chord Mojo and Schiit Lyr with several SN tubes Also tried it without the Lyr and straight out of the Mojo the WZ sounds awfully unnatural and fatiguing out of both I dare you to listen to Sledgehammer Rihanna with this you will throw it off of your head do not buy this You can do much better for the price and below Audio Technias own now outdated ATHAX sounds far better than this Sure it retrieves less detail and has even less bass but does not sound completely fake nor is it fatiguing,True,4.0,12.05.2018,510

956,positive,Ray,This is an inexpensive but wellconstructed mm lens hood It is advertised as useful for Zeiss but it works with most any mm lens I can use mine for both the Fuji mm F and Fuji F lenses for example It is quite inexpensive particularly when you compare it to the cost of brand name replacement lens hood It is made of a solid onepiece metal design maybe brass with a dull black paint coat The machining of the screw threads is pretty good so the hood screws on and off well The paint does not feel like it will come off unless it is seriously mistreated and the hood itself feels very sturdy Its hard not to recommend it for anyone looking for a replacement mm lens hood but check the user questions and answers to see what lenses people have used it with Also note that the hood comes either in standard vented tilted wide and wide S and each may have certain lenses for which they work so check this as well before purchasing None of them are expensive at all and considering the build quality its an EASY fivestar item,True,0.0,03.05.2018,194

964,positive,Mark R. Wietstock,Great amp for the price I bought it to replace an ancient JBL amp of the same power rating that finally croaked after having been in an equally ancient house PA system for about years It weighed about lbs and took up three rack spaces so yeah Id call this amp a big improvement over that The output connection options are a bit limited SpeakON and TS only no screwdown terminals give me a break we needed a foolproof replacement for banana connectors and SpeakON was the best we could do but that was no big deal for me easy enough to solder a TS plug on the speaker feed line I did not want to fiddle around with SpeakON for a darn mono hookup I like the builtin push button limiter and bridge options I am using both in this setting because the speaker interface is mono and I did not want to pay more for a higherpower amp that Id only be using half of or have to monkey around with special wiring configurations The push buttons made installation a snap The only thing I noticed as a bit of a negative on this amp is that when you are operating it in bridge modemono and possibly in stereo too but I did not try that a protection circuit keeps the amp silent on power up eg no pop in the speakers but there is no such circuitfeature active on power down so you get a small pop in your speakers especially where the amp is placed in a set up that requires its power switch to be in the on position all the time The pop is probably a little louder when you are operating in bridge mode too because its all going through one output mono instead of two stereo It would be nice if the amp had a powerdown protection circuit but that might add a bit more to the cost of the amp than the manufacturer is willing to do and that single issue is not a dealbreaker for me,True,0.0,21.02.2018,346

1030,positive,G.Z.,I have purchased many Logitech keyboards and mice over the years they work well and the battery life is outstanding My home workspace has changed recently with me often using my home and work laptops HP Lenovo coupled to full HD monitors and the constant hassle of using the correct keyboard and mouse with the appropriate laptop caused me to investigate Logitechs multidevice units While reading a very recent review someone noted that devices were on a price sale other outlets so I purchased a K keyboard in gray and an M mouse Both units worked well regarding the multidevice capability a quantum leap IMO of functionality when you have multiple devices like desktops laptops and phones as I do as a programmer though I have not tested on my Samsung Note The M mouse worked well though it was a bit sluggish on the HP perhaps due to a Bluetooth driver and the mouse favors righthanders I found the left edge where a rightys thumb sits to be a bit sharp irritating I now hold the mouse more loosely to adapt The K keyboard reviewed on many sites as the best Bluetooth mouse currently available worked OK but after a few days I noticed alot of missed keystrokes not helped by the smallish round key design and the key labelling was indistinct and difficult to read in my lighting and the lack of backlighting did not help But more importantly I found my hands getting pained by the slightly compressed key spacing on the K maybe those with smaller hands women kids would be OK with it but my hands are normal size and overall I found the keyboard literally painful and unpleasant to work with so I returned it and after some more research got the K from Amazon WOW what a difference it is now my favorite home keyboard replacing the K white solar unified though my old Mac fullsized white wired keyboard I use at work is also very nice fast and quiet the best for serious work The K is a beautiful keyboard is fairly quiet has quasichicklet keys with a short travel that is for me a perfect feel and there is something about the key plastic that feels almost jewellike slightly concave and a real joy to type on And the backlight turns on when needed it does not always turn on just by hovering like some reviewers report but I found that just touching my pinky slightly on the left or right edge of the keyboard depending on which hand is striking first always turns it on My initial monitoring of battery life Logitech reviewrated at days or more was days with heavy use and moderate backlighting All the keys are fine for size shape and typical placement and the lit CapsLock and CalculatorF button are nice bonuses Upperleft key is ESC upperright key is FORWARDDELETE with BACKSPACE below it and lowerleft key is CTRL unlike my Lenovo Note a reviewer said they did not like having to press the FN key to enable normal function key use vs the multimedia functions but that is customizable with Logitechs Setpoint app as are some other functions This is just an amazing keyboard sadly however after about weeks the key started getting intermittent failing more than half the time in my normal force typing I started having to hit it a bit harder than the rest with the left side of the key being particularly unresponsive and after a while I found it to be untenable a quick online chat with an Amazon rep and he sent me a replacement in days I hope the bad key issue was an isolated event because I do not know of a better keyboard for my situation and it really is an outstanding device for its multidevice functionality and great handson feel I rate it stars and deduct for the bad key B^ PROS beautiful if Logitech makes a white one I will buy it beautiful key feel there is nothing else like it up to devices multidevice is a musthave for me backlit keys another musthave Lit CapsLock indicator week battery life so far great considering backlighting small light but with normal key spacing standard miniusb charging cable supplied tiny rubber feet to keep it anchored but unnoticeable on your lap CONS gamers may prefer larger arrow keys and a full numeric keypad nonreplaceable lithium battery but I read there is web info on how to replace it yourself in a year or a bit pricey,True,2.0,27.04.2018,760

1201,neutral,Tom Servo,I believe this is the first Anker product I have ever bought that was a letdown of sorts You can not beat the price especially if you are like me and hesitant to make the jump from a conventional mouse to one of these ergonomic designs I get the impression this mouses components are actually fairly robust and will last long enough to more than justify the cost paid out for this item Unfortunately it has some flaws that render it one of the more difficult to use mice I have tried over the years Its a shame because I do believe I like this ergonomic layout and after just a few days I found myself unwilling to go back to a conventional mouse design First and foremost its super super slick My fingertips are constantly sliding down off the buttons they should be resting on I have average to slightly larger than average hands so the side of my hand already rests on the table with this mouse but if I try to hike up everything slides down immediately Because of this its actually easier to scroll the wheel with my pointer finger instead of my middle finger Sometimes my pointer finger is all the way down on the right mouse button too And on many occasions I have hit the DPI button which sits just south of the scroll wheel instead of hitting a button or the wheel itself The other buttonrelated issue is the forwardback nav buttons on the left hand side are up high and positioned in such a way that I can only really reach the back button They are also pretty flat and have a deep pressin so they can be difficult to click fully At least for me Overall its just OK If this cost as much as a Logitech Id definitely have rated it lower but as a budget pick it has flaws that may not be dealbreakers for some people My verdict is still out to be honest I have not decided if I want to try to return it to Amazon or try to keep it and put some grippy material on it to keep my fingers in place I have given feedback to Anker so Ill see what they think I should do Update After contacting Anker customer support I got to say they continue to amaze me with the aboveandbeyond nature of their service They offered to send a different mouse to try out and I received it a few days after accepting the offer Unfortunately that mouse is even worse than this one making my hand arm and elbow hurt within minutes of use But the fact that they were willing to let me try another model free of charge speaks highly of the confidence they have in their products Although neither mouse is a perfect fit for me Ill continue to use this model and see if I can put something grippy on it to help my hand stay in place And of course Ill continue to buy Anker products through Amazon because I know they are a company that will stand behind their products if something is not right,True,0.0,12.06.2018,534

1220,neutral,Prat,Its a good looking bag just the right size for what I was looking for I realize that most folks will use it as a day bag but I thought I could repurpose this as a camera bag since I wanted a bag that does not scream camera bag So this is a slightly different review and take it how you will I used this bag with a couple of camera inserts from ApeCase and Domke wrap that I had lying around I was able to fit the ApeCase Cubeze Pro the ApeCase Cubeze a poncho and a storm jacket The Apecases were used for carrying a full frame DSLR Canon D and lenses Rokinon mm Canon fL Canon fL and Canon fL In addition I could fit in a lens cleaning kit spare batteries memory cards a small laptop charger a camera flash couple of transceivers and a small Manfrotto tripod So with some thought you can fit in quite a bit of stuff in this bag Of course I did not carry all of this in the bag when I had it on my back would have been too heavy but this gives you an idea of how much you can pack in this Pros Seems pretty durable Looks good Can double up as a large messenger bag You can even slide off a strap and use it as a sling bag I did that frequently for quick access to camera and lenses Large enough for me Cons Not waterproof I had a spare rain sleeve with which I used the bag in light rain and it was okay The color comes off quite easily especially if you are sweating Its okay for a short walk but anything upwards of an hour you start sweating and the color comes off Poor ergonomics but you kind off expect that in a cheap canvas bag like this Pack light The shoulder strap is pretty thin and uncomfortable I used it with the shoulder strap from a different messenger bag and it was a lot better Using it as a messenger bag you do not have your sweaty back in contact with the bag and the color coming off is not that much of an issue any more As such this is not a bad bag I will keep it and continue to use it as an inconspicuous camera bagday bag but I will use it with a better shoulder strap than the one it comes with Knocked off the two stars for the poor shoulder strap the color fade and how uncomfortable it feels to carry on your back when walking around for even an hour or so,True,2.0,30.05.2018,448

McCranie,The instructions say to put drops of the liquid on a swab There is no easy way to do this I took the cap off expecting to see something that you could squeeze a drop out No You have to wedge out a plug which the directions call a cork and then you are left with a wide hole to the liquid Furthermore the bottle is too stiff to squeeze anyway There is no practical way to get out one or two drops unless maybe you dip in a cotton swab and transfer some to the kits swab But I have had problems in the past with other sensor cleaning kits by putting too much of the fluid on the swab Using a cotton swab to transfer some of the liquid to the cleaning swab does not give you the control you need to put the right amount on the cleaning swab,True,0.0,31.03.2018,152

Doe,I give it a It works after you get things set right and it looks nice when put put the cdroms face plate on it but it is not perfect and they are flaws The caddy has stickers on it that are supposed to be instructions However I noticed that they do not match my caddy The stickers show clips that do not exist on my caddy Also the stickers on mine do not point out an important position switch This caddy and many other cheap cdrom bay caddies has a position switch in the hard drive slot next to the SATA connectors It is very easy to overlook That switch is important because your drive might not work properly without being set in the correct position which is determined by trial and error If it is in the wrong position the computer might not find the hard drive or the laptop might have LEDs that never turn off when you try to shutdown the computer I had to disable fastboot on Windows to get Windows to see my drive Maybe changing the switch position again would have fixed that but I did not try it The caddy fits in my laptop well It slides right into the bay without much effort It fits the opening well so it does not have extra space to move or bounce around My laptops frame does not have any screw holes that match the caddys so it is held in place by friction However because the caddy fits my cdrom bay so well he laptops sata and power connectors provide enough friction that I do not have to worry about it working loose and falling out The face plate from my cdrom drive fits on the caddy perfectly However you should be very careful when removing the faceplate from the drive If you damage the faceplate it might not snap into the caddy correctly Removing the caddy is not the easiest task You have to try and pull it out using the cdroms face plate if you attached it and hope that it does not snap off If it does you have to use a screw driver to slowly pry it out I tried it on a few inch drives and of them fit perfectly However one of them a Kingston GB SSD barely fit and I worry that it might damage the drives sata connectors at some point Overall I do not regret the purchase but I would be shocked if there was not something better,True,0.0,05.04.2018,424

2596,positive,team W,This is kind of a weird product In a lot of ways these things punch above their weight They are better made more comfortable and have nicer features than you have any right to expect at this price I like the design with the cans swiveling back against the strap for storagetransport then folding back out when you are ready to use them I think tucking them in like that probably makes these less likely to break in your bag It took a little while to get a comfortable angle with them you kind of have to fiddle a bit with them when you first get them because the strap does not ride in the same place on your head that you are used to But after a few outings with them it gets easier to adjust them and make them comfortable I found them comfortable for extended wearing you can watch a movie in these and not be unhappy Given some of the reviews on here I did not expect much in terms of sound quality I was pleasantly surprised Are these going to blow you away with their audiophile quality No But they are not quite as bad as some of these other reviewers say They are reasonably accurate just a little flat sounding The highs are not that high the bass is not that strong but you are not exactly paying the kind of money where you should really expect amazing performance If you are just watching a movie or are not overly fussy about it they do get by I am not surprised that people are disappointed in how they sound They feel like headphones that should sound better than they do because they feel like headphones in a lot of ways But they are definitely not that expensive and where you notice it is in the sound quality The controls work fine and I like that the interface talks to you through the headphones in English so you know your bluetooth is paired know that the power has been turned off successfully etc That is again another nice feature you do not really expect at this price point It seems kind of funny to say you like a set of headphones that do not sound that great But I do like them at least for limited use largely traveling I think they are likely to hold up well they are comfortable and if they get stolen while I am traveling or I lose them I am not out a lot of money I can live with passable audio quality wrapped in an otherwise high quality package,False,0.0,27.07.2018,441

2655,negative,Lilith Salem Moon,The sound quality on this is horrible It makes my music sound like its in an underground cave filled with water and somehow staticky on top of that Its very odd My headphones alone are fine and sound great but if I plug in this extension its unlistenable It was truly a waste of money and that is sad I needed this item really bad and was looking very much forward to receiving it I am so disappointed Update The company was very gracious and sent another cable However the cord still does not work After playing with it and testing it on various headphones I discovered that the cable only works on headphones that do not have a volume control on them I had bought brand new earbuds and this to go with it so reverting back to a very old pair of headphones just so I can use this does not work for me I recommend in the future to make your extension cables compatible with current headphones Almost all are going to have a volume control on them I wish this item worked and I wish I did not have to leave negative feedback regarding the item But the cord is useless to anyone who is using current technology,True,0.0,02.02.2018,212

2710,negative,Patrick Kielty,TLDR You do not need a in sensor Just buy a motion sensor and you will be just as happy If every feature is worth of the retail price I am only getting of value out of this thing and not by choice Batteries NOT included do not let the price fool you into thinking this thing is a step above the competitors What can I say this thing is just okay For the price its really not worth the time and effort I would NOT buy another one I have been using this for months now I consider myself fairly tech savy and anticipate issues and I find that part of the fun This thing was simply frustrating For starters the thing was a pain to get setup I am running OpenHab with the Aeotec Zwave stick which works great btw and the zwave binding so you can automatically expect at least some work to get this thing going You can power it via micro usb or CRA batteries which are not included where are my going and the device behaves differently based on how you power it during the pairing For example if you power via micro usb it will act as a repeater and take more frequent readings It does not do the same when pairing via battery for obvious reasons I had to pair and unpair this thing so many times I only feel lucky that I was able to get it going I do not remember which I ended up pairing as but I left it alone as soon as I could get it working either way Oh and if you want to change any of the settings like temp threshold make sure you have Habmin if using OpenHab PaperUI always errors out It seems to only pick up its configuration reliably if it is powered via usb and is taking readings constantly The one big setting I wanted to change was the timeout from minutes to minutes for the lights This took a long time to get setup Seems simple enough but somehow they make it not so Next we should talk about the so called features of this device in they say but in reality only of the functions actually work for me Even then I really only use the motion portion Keep reading to see which of the others work Motion This has been the only great part Once I got the pairing down read the manual and everything added into Openhab I am able to reliably activate my hue bulbs when I walk into the room It took some angle adjustment and rule tweaking to get that right but it has been nearly flawless in its function the past two months I have it mounted to the ceiling and pointed toward the door slightly I have only had it not activate for whatever reason times and it quickly worked again after I flipped the light switch off and on Having motion lights has been great I am so used to it that now when I go down to my basement I accidentally walk past the light switch sometimes into the dark room because I expect the lights to come on I am researching other motion sensors for this room to add to my zwave mesh Humidity Next to worthless readings I have no idea if they are correct At least it reports a number though Temperature Same as Humidity but it seems to semi match the other temp gauge I have had in my room previous to this purchase Nothing useful about this information for me currently I suppose I could write a rule for my thermostat later on but even the I do not know that I would trust the readings Luminance Never has worked It is at lux of the time It just happens to be at lux as I type this which according to a chart I consulted is pretty darkpitch black I have the curtains open in the room and the sun is shining in Still lux I would not write any rules around lux if I were you Very unreliable AlarmVibration What The reading is always I guess this is the tamper setting You are not going to stop the person trying to remove this from its mounting So what is the point Not worth spending extra money on a sensor for this UV Again always It is inside so maybe it is So then why do I have a sensor with UV detection Battery It reads but what good is a reading if its forever I have been running it for months on batteries so maybe it really is still This reading is purely for my own information I guess Ill just wait until it stop turning the lights on and then swap the batteries This was my first motion sensor and I learned a lot about OpenHab and Zwave getting it configured Still would not buy it again or recommend for a first time user I look forward to trying out some sensors and switches from other brands that I have read to be good,True,5.0,28.04.2018,861

2719,neutral,JokingJ,For the price this filter performs pretty much how one would expect If I had to add something to the you get what you pay for adage it would probably be and you do not get what you do not pay for The standard baseline features are certainly here when you twist the filter the amount of light entering the lens decreases while still remaining basically transparent After that basic fact there is not much else to call meritworthy Because its too cheap for multicoating the filter does suffer from some ghosting and reflections when shooting bright points of light hello night photography Because the engineering is perhaps a little cut rate the min and max markings meant to denote the transition between the ND settings serve more as suggestions rather than true guides Likewise the shallow filter thread does not always catch easily and sometimes leads to misalignment And finally at the highest ND settings ie near x there is a noticeable drop in image quality at least in higher resolution stills and some Xshaped gradient patterning emerges as well Those are all things that tend not to be an issue with more expensive filters All that being said for casual work and probably for most video needs certainly shooting at p this filter does the job I personally purchased this Zomei expecting these drawbacks and it did not disappoint But for around its hard to fault the Zomei it delivers exactly the performance you would expect for the price maybe even a little better If you want the performance of a filter that is probably what you will have to pay If not the Zomei will do just know what you are giving up,True,6.0,01.02.2018,286

2868,neutral,Amazon Customer,Id give this receiver more stars but I got a defective unit It has problems The first is the less serious one but it is intermittent When I go into the setup mode I love the onscreen display of what is happening on my tv screen More than half the time the onscreen display stays in sync with the oneline display on the front of the receiver However about of the time it lags behind by as much as longest delay timed by stopwatch seconds and when this is going on the least delay is about seconds So that problem is a pain but I supposed I could live with it if I were past the return for refund and buy another unit stage Thank goodness I am not and Ill be receiving my replacement this weekend However the other problem is a major showstopper and its the reason why I am returning the unit When I first set up wifi on the receiver everything worked without a hitch BACKGROUND I am a computer geek for a living and I am extremely familiar with tcpip networking both wired and wireless going up to at lest the OC level anyway common gigabitandlower speed networks I can do in my sleep its a part of my job However about days later the receiver lost its network connection and could not reconnect So I tried going through the setup procedure again but this time after I entered the password the receiver could not connect That is it appeared to hang for at least a minute then it display ed the connection failure message and after that it put me back at the setup prompt menu option This is essentially the same problem that people have complained about with Onkyo receivers since at least and apparently Onkyo still has not figured out that there is a problem Sigh Actually at this point I have been through that procedure over times with the same results every time I have tried every variation I could think of including but not limited to the following not in this order but close to it turning off and unplugging the receiver for minutes ditto for the wifi gateway and then bringing up wifi and after it was up plugging the receiver back in and turning it on letting it go through its startup process moving the wifi gateway significantly closer to the receiver feet instead of trying a second and then a third wifi gateway different box different private network turning off ALL electronics which do wifi EXCEPT the receiver and the tv and then turning off wifi on the tv set downloading and installing new firmware for the receiver checking power qualityvoltagefrequency going to the receiver and all the electronics on that power circuit naturally I had already RTFMed but I reread it and made sure that every instruction had been followed to the letter boring searched online for possible solutions including the Onkyo forum I could not post there though because after several days of waiting I am still waiting for permission to post sigh a notallthatheartening experience contacted Amazon tech support contacted a former coworker who now does highend installations for home entertainment systems he was the first one who told me to go ahead and return it Now before ordering this receiver I read literally ALL of its and star reviews why not read the star because one is not likely to find someone with the real problems there Ignoring the wifi problem which also made it impossible to use my phone as its remote there was one other minor issue but it could be cockpit error My wife had downloaded an IR remote before I set up the wifi and got the wireless app for our phones It worked fine at first but after the wifi went down its a little on the iffy side While her phone is fairly new and she usually keeps it fully charged I do not know what was going on and while she has gone through multiple days of the IR remote on her phone working intermittently when I tried it it only failed to work twice out of probably button pushes she gets maybe out of when it is acting flaky so I do not know whether its her phone or the receiver The same app installs fine on my galaxy S but it can not talk to the receiver at all again it could be a problem with MY phone Soundwise the receiver is excellent and its array of sources and connections a big reason I picked this receiver since we have a large vinyl collection of classical music and it actually has a decent phono input and its sound is EXCELLENT well excellent considering the speakers we have and they are being replaced soon anyway Now this is NOT the same quality as the MacIntosh tubetype system I had used up until a couple of years ago but then it cost less that what that system cost and I could not justify buying a replacement system at that price level granted BUT the sound is excellent and for probably of people who listen to their systems not more than a few hours a day it will be far better than they could ever expect at this price I forgot to mention my wife is a professional performing classical musician and probably has better ears than I do and she likes it better than the Mac system so if she who is usually VERY picky about such things is satisfied I will take her opinion as fact The sound of this thing is amazing And the ability to run a second set of speakers with even a different source is an added bonus One more thing We have an extensive library of recordings made from live performances and onair performances going back more than years they are all on tape and reeltoreel cassette and dataudio recordings But like most receivers in this price range or even at significantly higher ones it has no tapeout option We solved that the easy way The zone line out connections can be used to drive a recording device so we got around that problem altogether I understand that most people do not know or care about such things but if you are one of them that is the easy solution We have a separate preamp which we use to drive any of different recording devices as needed and its output can go to the separate zone receiver as well So would I buy this receiver again I can not say that until I get the replacement this weekend If its OK Ill raise the review to stars not it has taken too much to find out that I had to replace the thing and why did i come through with this problem in the first place Otherwise Ill add a note that the replacement was bad too and I may lower but will not raise the rating,True,2.0,02.02.2018,1177

2963,negative,Karl Bielefeldt,I received both the EQ and the AZ this telescope for review When I first got into astronomy people recommended getting a reflector telescope instead of a smaller refractor like this one Having had the opportunity to try both I can say that advice was sound The EQ might be usable by beginners due to its nice mount but this one was difficult to use The mount has relatively sturdy legs but I found moving the telescope around to be quite difficult You have to take a lot of care to tighten one screw while moving through the other axis and on the larger magnifications it made it very difficult to get centered on what you want to look at compared to a dobsonian mount I did like the equatorial mount of the EQ As far as image quality goes I had significant color fringing on bright objects like Jupiter This was improved somewhat by using the smaller opening on the end cap but still was not as nice as a reflector I will try to post some pictures showing the difference if I get a chance The eyepieces have a usable amount of eye relief but somewhat of a tunnel effect where you have to look exactly straight My yearold had trouble looking through it I would give this telescope a pass and either get a cheap dobsonian reflector or possibly the EQ The difference in this case is worth it,False,0.0,10.09.2018,242

3069,negative,Beeker318,This product could be great Picture is clear with good color Customization controls are vast PTZ is quick Unfortunately for me all of that is worthless due to the unusable software I purchased both a IPMW and EW Neither of these cameras will connect using the app for my IPad For my Android phone the nonPOE camera will not connect over WiFi and the lag trying to control PTZ anywhere except when I am connected to my home network is so bad it makes them unusable on the phone So no mobile connectivity While I can connect and see video using the IP Configuration Tool at home there is no PTZ control from that app The Web View plugin for Chrome would connect but there was no video I could PTZ control the cameras Firefox repeatedly asked for the plugin Strangely I can use the EXACT same version number of Chrome at work after setting up port forwarding and view both cameras as long as they were connected via cable When connected via WiFi it would not connect I contacted technical support and spoke with a rather rude technician whose accent was very heavy and frankly difficult to understand He wanted to connect to my local PC which I thought was odd and immediately launched Edge or IE or whatever its called now and setup a shortcut for it Granted it did connect AND show video but I do not want to use IE His response I think was that there was a problem with the Chrome plugin and this was the solution While there may be some other setup differences between Chrome at work and home they are the exact same version so that explanation does not fly with me Given the large number of similar complaintsconcerns about the software this is not an isolated incident although I acknowledge not everyone experiences it For me the frustration level with the company has surpassed my appreciation of their camera It looks like both cameras are going back and I will look for an alternative brand If you are reading this Amcrest Ill give you one week to respond and provide a workable solution that fits my needs One last note I have an older IP camera that is the exact opposite of all of this Image quality is not great that is why I was replacing it BUT I can connect via Chrome at work home or anywhere I have tried IPad app works as does Android Per Amcrests request I reached out to them and the company was unable to correct ANY of the issues listed Their answer to selling a product that says it works with Chrome is to have the technical support team acknowledge that sometimes the chrome app just does not work and then offer IE as a viable alternative The IPad app not working issue was similar try the app for the phone That also did not work There was no suggestion as to why the Android app had such scattershot andor jerky control behavior The cameras are going back I am disappointed with Amcrest,True,0.0,01.03.2018,520

3105,negative,Harry Brill Jr.,I bought several of these in several sizes on different occasions maybe a year apart Now less than years later with an average of uses per month the plastic tabs on nearly all of the original order are busted off on at least one end This is a wear issue from pressing the tab to disconnect the cable I have started replacing the ends as I have time I have a pair of cables that were made for me using CAT bulk cable and RJ EZ connectors about the same time as my original purchase of these that are still going strong with no sign of breaking It is my conclusion the plastic on these is not appropriate for this purpose If I have some other CATE cables that are years old and still fine If not for this experience I would not have judged them so harshly I will not be buying anymore and I will be switching sources for my patch cables On a positive note each pair is individually wrapped with foil I think they are probably fine if you just plug them in and leave them plugged in for the life of the cable,True,0.0,09.04.2018,198

3378,positive,Jtel87,As a working professional I needed a simple easy inexpensive to use calculator for online college classes The Casio FXEX served and exceeded my expectations Over the years I have HP and Texas Instruments including HPS HPg HP Prime TIX Pro and TITitanium I must say the Casio FXEX deserves a try to those in college classes despite the fact that TI currently conquers over of US market share for educational markets Per the NCEES web site FXEX is approved for use use in FE and PE examination The calculator is well made with easy to read big font and lines display It is intuitive and easy to figure out the various interfaces Best of all it is pretty inexpensive as compared to TI calculator Personally I feel TI calculator is overrated and does not deserve the price I am paying for To me the TI calculator monopolizes over US institutions Almost every other teachers are using it It seems to me that is what the teachers are familiar with to use to teach students In my view every does not equate to it being good I probably attribute it to the good sales and marketing strategies of Texas Instruments sales folks If I can personally decide HP g is one of the best However it can not be use in most examination due to its CAS capabilities FXEX is similar in functionalities to TIX Pro and it is better in my opinion It has spreadsheet and table features similar to a very small excel You can input formulas like Excel and propagate using cells Due to its very small memory you can only do it for upto x cells It is better than no excel features on a small calculator As for the disadvantages it can not be programmed and the display can be slightly dimmed in low light conditions To all those diehard TI fans give this Casio FXEX a try You will not be disappointed I am using it as a secondary andor primary calculator to my HP calculators,True,0.0,25.03.2018,342

3958,negative,Pete,These are pretty good headphones as long as you restrict their use in two ways First do not expect them to maintain connection to the base with more than about feet of separation in normal household conditions ie through more than one wall Second they have a nonadjustable autosleep function that powers down the speakers after only about seconds of silence When the source resumes you will miss the first couple of seconds of audio you will probably never notice it when listening to music continuously but when listening to something like duolingo its going to drive you crazy There is nothing in the manual about this The only solution I have found is to keep another audio source running at all times at very low levels that will not interfere with whatever my main task is at the moment,True,0.0,12.02.2018,140

3965,neutral,Doug,Summary Good Very nice video quality Great range of video resolutions Nice UI for settings much better than my Hero Silver Needs Improvement The Flat color profile looks like it just turns down saturation Its not nearly as nice as GoPros Flat profile that boosts Dynamic Range and increase bit rate External mic is Mono only not stereo which it could be The Bad Audio is horrible It sounds like you are in a cave and what audio is recorded is very tinny Very little to no bass even with an external mic It will randomly change modes I will be recording video and after I stop recording using voice control it will change to photoburst on its own Very odd and annoying In Detail I am a video pro who has used a number of cameras from high end DSLRs to action cameras like this for my videos The action cameras I have used include Sony AS Sony AS GoPro Hero Silver GoPro Hero Black Yi K and now the Yi K They all have their pros and cons Sony tends to have the best cameras but that form factor does not work with gimbalsso they are out for me But back to the Yi K My main use for these cameras is recording MTB videos using an Evo SS gimbal The fast action and environment present some unique challenges for action cams audio and video recording How does the Yi K fare It is a good camera with a nice set of features However several of them seem unfinished or like they cut corners Video Video quality is very good I have no complaints about the overall image quality I could pixel peep and compare to others but they are so close this would be a waste of time I have looked at YouTube videos from others and they say the GoPro is better but you have to zoom in to on a still image Given my videos are action viewers are likely to never notice a difference and certainly not say Too bad the image quality is poor Quite the opposite they think it looks great I do have a few gripes however The Flat video setting is not really worth using It adds a very strange tint and reduces saturation GoPros Flat setting is much better It adds more Dynamic Range and increases bit rate I can get much better looking video using GoPros flat vs the standard GoPro setting On the Yi I use the standard setting because the Flat does not make it look better and only make post processing a huge hassle The resolution options are very good I have settled on the K x option It allows me to adjust the composition in post to make sure I get the shot and still have full K resolution For the video alone I give it stars Audio This is where it really is terrible The in camera audio is distant and tinny The stereo is barely functional as both mics seem to pick up nearly the same sound I wonder if it has one mic but two holes to make it seem like two mics Having one mic on the side is a problem with gimbals The mic will pick up the gimbal noise making audio unusable you will want to use external mics for audio About thatI have a Sony ECM CS mic and it too sounds pretty bad The recorder in the Yi is either very low quality or the firmware is really holding it back It also can only record mono audio with an external mic despite the mic I have being stereo With an external mic the audio is better much better but still tinny sounding Very little bass The audio settings Low and High seem a bit too low and a bit too high High clips too easily While low seems to add a gate around dB so you do not get anything higher than that That tends to make the audio sound too narrow Loud stuff is not much louder than quieter stuff If Low did not max the audio where it does it would be better For just Audio I give it a Features The Yi K has some nice features that set it apart from others Voice control is very handy and works well However it could be better I have to repeat myself a few times and when that mode is on it seems to allow the camera to change modes randomly Wifi works very well and pairs quickly with the App However one big issue is if you have your phones data on it will not show a video preview You have to turn off cellular data to get the video preview iPhone plus is what I use but happens with others too The on screen user interface is very nice They get high marks for that For the features I give it a The wifidata issue is a big problem for how I use it Other details to noterate One GREAT aspect of this camera is the built in tripod mount That makes it much easer to attach no case and adapters needed The USBC cover on the other hand is super annoying It does not stay in place and just flops around As it hits the camera in use that sound is picked up by the mic You will need to tape over it to hold it in place For the extras I give it a as well The USBC cover is such an easy thing to get rightand they got it wrong with consequences to your audio Overall its great for casual users and some advanced use However if you need to get the best quality money can buy you should consider the Sony options GoPro if you need the form factor However then you are dealing with GoPro audio issues as well The best quality is a GoPro with external audio Most use a Hero Black as a B camera and Senhiesser GoPro mic However that is a dual camera setup For me this camera with an external mic is good enough but barely for my needs I am considering going back to the GoPro Hero Black It was just a solid performer However the x fps option of the Yi K is what keeps me with the Yifor now,True,54.0,14.01.2018,1071

Anderson,I really wanted to install one of these sensors on the door leading into my garage My garage receives a decent albeit not extremely powerful WiFi signal from my router When I am in the garage my iPhone connects to Wifi just fine but I could not get this door sensor to properly install in the garage The installation kept failing So I decided to move it the downstairs door which is much closer to my Wifi router Once I did that installation succeeded the first time so the only thing I can conclude on this is this sensor needs a very strong signal to work Once I got it installed it works but some of the results are less than desirable First off I can not get it to work with Apple Homekit Maybe this device is not Apple Homekit compatible but that was a big disappointment Because of this I was unable to get alerts on my wifes iPhone along with mine Once I got it set up in the app it gave me the option to invite someone else to receive notifications so I invited my wife She received an alert on her phone but the alert was from the Homekit app and since I could not get the device to work with Homekit she was never able to set it up I installed the iHome app and signed her in under my account hoping it would mirror the notifications that I receive when the door is opened but no luck only I receive notifications So another big failure in that only person in the house can get notifications that the door opens Also the notifications are pretty crappy Sometimes they can be a minute delay between the door opening and me getting a push notification on my phone Also even though I have sound enabled on my phone the notifications are silent and just send a message no beeping for an alert So unless I am looking at my phone Ill never know if the door was open or not yes they do appear as a historical alert in my notifications listing so I can go back and see it later on In conclusion the device does work but it needs a very strong wifi signal its integration with Homekit does not work notifications are disappointing and only one of us can receive alerts,False,0.0,28.01.2018,398

4489,negative,Charles R. De Haven,I just purchased the Micca model MZ I would not recommend purchasing this digital frame It came with a remote that the manual does not describe how to use adequately The remote is necessary in order use all the functions that the digital frame is capable of performing In addition part of the product description is inaccurate It says easy to use and part of it is You plug it in and insert whatever source of the pictures you want to display and turn it on It does that quite well The caveat is that for all more complicated functions to be accessed you need the remote The remote is poorly designed as is the complicated interface that is displayed by the remote The manual does nothing in the way of explaining how to use the remote It says under the necessary setup function CALENDAR this To view calendar select Calendar icon That works Then it says nothing more except to be sure to set the date and time properly No explanation is provided how to do this Because of the clunky interface I could not do it It is not intuitive at all Like all gadgets that you need to set the date and time on they decide to reinvent the wheel I was unable to set the time with no explanation from the manual and the confusing interface One of the features that I purchased this digital picture frame was the ability to have it turn off and on automatically This not mentioned in the manual I do not believe it can even do this If I could have given a rating I would have So I recommend buying another product than this one It does have good picture quality in its display,True,2.0,03.04.2018,295

4496,positive,acrane,An affordable fadervariable ND filter This mm filter is on my mm Sigma and it preforms very well Just like my mm Bower the action is smooth for fading The other feature I really like is that it has a stop built into the MIN and MAX so you can not move past the filters range causing image issues Going into buying this I knew shooting at a wide angle mm and a high ND stop that there was the potential for the X pattern And while it does happen it is not a deal breaker for me The overall quality of the shots and video are still very good Eventually I will buy a stop ND so if needed I can shoot at mm and stop my camera down and not have the pattern For now this filter is great for my shootingvideo needs Pros Smooth fading MinMax stop Affordable Feels well built Cons Wide Angle lenses may suffer from X pattern issues this is likely with any VariableFader ND though Slight color shift to cooler side,True,3.0,28.03.2018,178
